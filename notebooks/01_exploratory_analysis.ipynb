# Exploratory Analysis

This notebook contains the initial exploratory analysis of system-level
metrics used for multivariate anomaly detection.

The focus is on understanding metric behaviour, correlations, and
temporal patterns prior to model development.

## Exploratory Analysis Plan

The exploratory analysis will focus on:

- Understanding temporal trends in memory-related metrics
- Identifying correlations between multiple system metrics
- Detecting early signs of abnormal behaviour
- Visualising normal vs anomalous patterns over time

This step helps inform feature selection and model choice
for subsequent anomaly detection approaches.
