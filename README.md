# Multivariate Anomaly Detection for Memory Leak Identification

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting memory leak patterns in software systems
using multivariate anomaly detection on system-level metrics collected
over time.

The goal is to identify abnormal behaviour that cannot be captured by
single-metric thresholding approaches.

## Context
This work is based on my MSc practicum at Dublin City University and has
been restructured here as a clean, professional portfolio project.

## Objectives
- Analyse multivariate time-series system metrics
- Detect anomalous patterns indicating potential memory leaks
- Compare different anomaly detection approaches

## Status
Project setup in progress. Documentation and structure completed first,
followed by model implementation and evaluation.
